        Hey, you're not permitted in there. It's restricted. You'll be deactivated for sure.. Don't call me a mindless
        philosopher, you overweight glob of grease! Now come out before somebody sees you. Secret mission? What plans?
        What are you talking about? I'm not getting in there! I'm going to regret this. There goes another one. Hold
        your fire. There are no life forms. It must have been short-circuited. That's funny, the damage doesn't look as
        bad from out here. Are you sure this things safe?

        What a piece of junk. She'll make point five beyond the speed of light. She may not look like much, but she's
        got it where it counts, kid. I've added some special modifications myself. We're a little rushed, so if you'll
        hurry aboard we'll get out of here. Hello, sir. Which way? All right, men. Load your weapons! Stop that ship!
        Blast 'em! Chewie, get us out of here! Oh, my. I'd forgotten how much I hate space travel.

        Run, Luke! Run!
